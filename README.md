# Notes Creator

## Description

This application allows a user to write, save, and delete notes. The user enters a title and text for a note, then presses the save button. The save button sends a request to the server and adds the new note to a JSON file that stores all the notes. The data from this JSON file then gets rendered on the page, where the user can click the note to view the text or delete it. Deleting the note sends a request to the server to remove the information from the JSON file and then render the remaining notes on the website.

## Usage

The user adds and deletes notes as desired for personal use.
